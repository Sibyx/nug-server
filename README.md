# nug-server

**Work in progress**

Simple KVM switch with RFB output written in Python based on the
[asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-protocol.html) module.

This project is a part of my master thesis on the
[Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies STU in Bratislava](https://www.fiit.stuba.sk/en.html) on the
subject of KVM switch implementation.
